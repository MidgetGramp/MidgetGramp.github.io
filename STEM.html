		<h1><u><strong>Science</strong></u></h1>
		<p>One of the key portions of our school's curriculum is science. Science is an important part of how many see the world today. Belton High School strives to teach science so that the next generation will readily be able to measure and observe the real world, collect data by various means, and draw logical conclusions from said data. Belton has numerous classes that focus on the science portion of STEM:</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type: square; background-color: white">
			<li>
				AP Physics - An advanced placement class that focuses on advanced problem solving in relation to physics. Touching lightly on calculus based physics, this class incorporates numerous experimental labs to reinforce the theoretical work.<br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				AP Botany - An advanced placement class that focuses on the micro and macro functionings of botanical organisms. Heavily based in chemistry, this class integrates live plant samples and advanced scientific equipment to aid students in identifying organisms, understanding the functions, and grasping the ecological interactions.<br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				AP Chemistry - An advanced placement class that focuses on the chemical properties and reactions of elements and compounds, both synthetic and natural. Theoretical work is cemented with additional data from chemical labs, often involving complex tasks in order to create, identify, or react certain compounds.<br/>
			</li>

		<h1><u><strong>Technology</strong></u></h1>
		<p>Another integral part of the Belton High School is its commitment to integrating technology into the lives of all students. The 1:1 Intitiative puts an electronic device in the form of an iPad for eighth and ninth graders and a Macbook Air for above grades. This allows high levels of productivity and helps reinforce one of the key components of the STEM program: how the advancement of technology has allowed for incredible tools that can be used to create in every area. In addition to the 1:1 Initiative, Belton High School offers several other technology focused classes:
		<ul style="list-style-type: square; background-color: white">
			<li>
				Web Design - This class focuses on the software skills needed to develop and maintain a website. Focusing on HTML and CSS languages and briefly touching on Javascript, this class is a good beginning class for coding and helps develop the logic and mindset needed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Software Development - This class is a more rigorous course designed to teach the various coding languages used to develop applications, create software, and manage networks. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Digital Electronics - This class is a Project Lead the Way course focused on the hardware portion of technology. This class includes basic circuit design, extensive digital logic problems, and soldering skills.
			</li>

		<h1><u><strong>Engineering</strong></u></h1>
		<p>The third element of the STEM program is engineering. Engineering is essentially the most practical application of the other three elements. Focused on designing products, solving problems, and improving processes, engineering is also one of the most heavily endorsed elements by Belton High School. Classes based in engineering include:
		<ul style="list-style-type: square; background-color: white">
			<li>
				Introduction to Engineering Design - This class is focused on the principles and rules that it takes to become an engineer. Including skills in drafting, three dimensional computer modeling, and an overview of the design process, this is the first Project Lead the Way class available at Belton High School to ninth graders.
			</li>
			<li>
				Principles of Engineering - This Project Lead the Way class is the next step up from Introduction to Engineering Design. This is more math intensive and focuses on a lot of the mathematical strategies involved in engineering.
			</li>
			<li>
				Computer Integrated Manufacturing - This is a Project Lead the Way class that focuses on the manufacturing processes of today's society with a heavy emphasis on robotics. 
			</li>

		<h1><u><strong>Math</strong></u></h1>
		<p>One of the most important parts of STEM is the math portion. Math is critical to understand all of the other parts of STEM and Belton High School endeavours to encourage growth in this portion as much as possible. Belton has several classes that develop this core skill:
		<ul style="list-style-type: square; background-color: white">
			<li>
				Dual Credit Precalculus - This class is a college credit precursor to calculus that adjusts a student's perspective to a different type of mathematics. Focusing strongly on trigonometrics and limits, as well as the fundamental basics of calculus.
			</li>
			<li>
				Dual Credit Calculus - This class shows the process of using calculus in theoretical situations. Initially focusing on the essentials and providing the knowledge to operate in the calculus methods, it later changes focus to real world scenarios that can be solved using calculus.
			</li>
			<li>
				Dual Credit Statistics - This class focuses on the analyzing and manipulation of vast amounts of data to reveal and draw further conclusions. By focusing on the main statistical tools, this class can quickly change to a more practical method.
			</li>
